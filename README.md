# Spring Kafka Test Consumer

## Goal 

The goal of this lab is to build and run a simple Spring Kafka Test Consumer. This will demonstrate the built in support for Integration tests provided by Spring Kafka for testing your applications. 

We have added an initial Spring Boot Application which you will use to create the Kafka Consumer and the docker-compose file you will need to run the Kafka Broker as we did in the previous labs.

## Task - Create a Spring Kafka Consumer

## Task - Add a Spring Kafka Consumer Test
